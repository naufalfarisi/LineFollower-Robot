This project is for the final project task in my Robotic Experiment I Class. The robot's objective is to follow the black line from the start to the end of the track. In this project, I am responsible for both the electrical and programming aspects of the robot. I have created an analog sensor using an LED and a photodiode to detect the line. The robot is programmed with a PID controller for its movement.

Part used in robot : 
- Arduino Nano
- Arduino Nano Shield
- LN298n Motor Driver
- Motor DC
- LM2596 Step Down Module
- 11.1 V Battery 3S
- LED
- Photodiode
- Push Button

The program is included in this repository, Thank you !
